# Sakura

Sakura is an elegant, high-contrast theme for Omarchy inspired by the delicate beauty of cherry blossoms. It brings the serene atmosphere of a Japanese spring garden to your coding environment. Designed for those who appreciate refined aesthetics and exceptional readability, it creates a focused workspace as peaceful as sitting beneath blooming sakura trees.
